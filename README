pycmb -- Python framework for CMB analysis
==========================================

This is a subset of the Python code developed for the Master
thesis of Dag Sverre Seljebotn (see http://heim.ifi.uio.no/dagss).

The intention is to include both a framework for doing Python
programming within CMB analysis, and a set of command line wrappers
around various standalone features in the framework. Currently
there is one such program:

  - cmbcr -- A program for doing constrained realizations, see
             cmb/apps/cmbcr.py

This is work in progress! If you want to use this code, it's probably
best to drop me an email. The constrained realization part is however
fairly stable and well tested.

There are no installation instructions yet, so see the SConscript file.

Dependencies:

  - healpix4py: http://github.com/healpix4py
  - NumPy, SciPy, scons, etc.
